For this challenge we were tasked with creating an earthquake visualization:

- This challenge was composed of a mandatory Part 1 and an optional Part 2, unfortunately I will need to come back to do part 2.

- Part 1 Required that we:
- Get our dataset from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page, in this case I chose to use the link that covers earthquakes from the entire week.
- After choosing a dataset we needed to create a visualization that showed markers on the locations of earthquakes, which were:
- Colored based on the depth of the earthquake (greater depth means darker colors) and the magnitude of the earthquake (higher magnitude means larger circles)
- We also needed to allow users to click the circles to get other information about the earthquakes.
- Finally we needed to create a legend that showed what the color of each circle meant (What color meant what depth)
